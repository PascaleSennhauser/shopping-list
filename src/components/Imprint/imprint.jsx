                <h2 id="mOverview">Overview of processing</h2>
                <p>The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and refers to
                    the
                    data subjects.</p>
                <h3>Types of data processed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory data.</li>
                    <li>Contact details.</li>
                    <li>Content data.</li>
                    <li>Usage data.</li>
                    <li>Meta, communication and process data.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Categories of affected persons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication partner.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Purposes of the processing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication.</li>
                    <li>Organizational and administrative procedures.</li>
                    <li>Feedback.</li>
                    <li>Provision of our online services and user-friendliness.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="m2427">Relevant legal bases</h2>
                <p><strong>Relevant legal basis according to the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong>If you are located in
                    Switzerland,
                    we process your data on the basis of the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“Swiss FADP” for short). Unlike
                    the
                    FADPO, for example, the Swiss FADP does not generally require that a legal basis for the processing of personal
                    data
                    be specified and that the processing of personal data be carried out in good faith, lawfully and proportionately
                    (Art. 6 para. 1 and 2 of the Swiss FADP). In addition, personal data will only be obtained by us for a specific
                    purpose that is recognizable to the data subject and will only be processed in a manner that is compatible with
                    this
                    purpose (Art. 6 para. 3 of the Swiss FADP).</p>

                <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
                <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into
                    account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the
                    processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and
                    freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by
                    controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transfer, safeguarding of
                    availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data
                    subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection
                    of
                    personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance
                    with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default
                    settings.</p>
                <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our
                    online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and
                    Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These
                    technologies
                    encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers),
                    protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that
                    all
                    data transmissions meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this
                    is
                    signaled by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being
                    transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>

                <h2 id="m12">General information on data storage and deletion</h2>
                <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as the underlying
                    consents are revoked or there is no further legal basis for the processing. This applies to cases in which the
                    original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule
                    exist if
                    legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.</p>
                <p>In particular, data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal
                    prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.</p>
                <p>Our data protection information contains additional information on the retention and deletion of data that
                    applies
                    specifically to certain processing operations.</p>
                <p>If there is more than one indication of the retention period or deletion period for a date, the longest period is
                    always decisive.</p>
                <p>If a period does not expressly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically begins at the
                    end
                    of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual
                    relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the date on which the
                    termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.
                </p>
                <p>We only process data that is no longer stored for the originally intended purpose, but due to legal requirements
                    or
                    other reasons, for the reasons that justify its storage.</p>

                    <li><strong>Meta, communication and process data:</strong> Meta data, communication data and procedural data are
                        categories that contain information about the way in which data is processed, transmitted and managed. Meta
                        data, also known as data about data, includes information that describes the context, origin and structure
                        of
                        other data. It can include information on file size, creation date, the author of a document and change
                        histories. Communication data records the exchange of information between users via various channels, such
                        as
                        e-mail traffic, call logs, messages in social networks and chat histories, including the persons involved,
                        time
                        stamps and transmission paths. Procedural data describes the processes and procedures within systems or
                        organizations, including workflow documentation, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used to
                        track and review operations. </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refers to information that records how users interact with digital
                        products, services or platforms. This data includes a wide range of information that shows how users use
                        applications, which functions they prefer, how long they stay on certain pages and which paths they use to
                        navigate through an application. Usage data can also include frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP
                        addresses, device information and location data. It is particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour,
                        optimizing user experiences, personalizing content and improving products or services. In addition, usage
                        data
                        plays a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences and potential problem areas within digital
                        offerings.
